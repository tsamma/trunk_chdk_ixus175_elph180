=1.5=
Unstable development branch. Significant changes should be recorded below.

=1.4=
Current stable, released Nov 29 2015 as 1.4.1.

Compatibility with 1.3:
* Scripts are generally compatible.
  You will see a warning if @chdk_version is not specified in the script header, but 1.3 compatible behavior will be used. If you use @chdk_version 1.4, the return values of some functions are changed.
  See https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/chdk/trunk/CHDK/LUALIB/wrap13.lua for a list of functions with changed return values
* Some CHDK script mode numbers have changed, and some names have been removed. This does not affect common modes like, M, P and Auto, but might affect scripts that use more obscure modes, especially if the are referred to by number rather than capmode.lua names
* CFG files: CHDK 1.4 uses the same CFG files as 1.3.
  It should generally be compatible and retain your settings, but if you don't want to risk re-doing your CFG, backing up the CHDK/*.CFG files before updating is recommended.  Custom colors will be reset, and if you switch back to 1.3, colors may be incorrect. CHDK 1.2 CFGs should be migrated as was done for 1.3.
* Modules and language files are NOT compatible. You must update these when you update your build.

Significant changes:
* long file name support in script, file browser / selector.

  Discussion: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12121.0 
* upper and lower case single characters can now be used as @param variables in uBASIC
* script header now supports @subtitle for better organization in script that use many parameters
* Lua scripts now "compile" when loaded to reduce memory needed (original script text no longer stored in memory)
  Discussion: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12117.msg118923#msg118923
* Added @chdk_version parameter to specify version of CHDK script was written for, 1.3 assumed if none present.
  Discussion: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12138.0
* Made Lua script API use of boolean values more consistent, (@chdk_version 1.3 provides backward compatible behavior)
  Development thread http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12138.0
* enhanced UI functions for touchscreen equipped cameras - touching menu areas and window buttons directly now works
  Discussion: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12090.msg118468#msg118468
* rework of CHDK color palette handling to allow separate palette definitions for each camera model - transparent grey color defined for OSD background use
  Discussion http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12046.msg118169#msg118169
* updates to GPS functionality for cameras with built-in GPS
* improvements in console handling when script running including console not timing out and console reset to "on" state when script errors are encountered.

  Discussion: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=11081.10
* scripts added to the User Menu can now be started directly from the User Menu via a full press on the shutter button.  Using Func/Set now brings up a dialog box for ok/cancel.  Selecting ok makes the script the current script and exits to the Script menu.

* filewrite / remote capture support for many more cameras
* development support for digic 6 / thumb2 cameras
* Improved focus overrides
