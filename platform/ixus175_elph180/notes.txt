To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.

This is a beta port, use at your own risk!

WARNING
During early development of this port, one camera suffered an unrecoverable
hardware failure apparently connected to a CHDK crash. Another camera suffered
a similar failure but was eventually recovered. See discussion starting at
http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12321.msg123736#msg123736
for details.
Several possible causes were identified and fixed, but the actual cause has
not been conclusively identified.

Use of CHDK is always at your own risk.

This port could not have been done without the help of the CHDK folks.
Without any specific order, thanks to reyalp, waterwingz, srsa_4c;
Thanks to amavroidis for donating the camera to help testing;
